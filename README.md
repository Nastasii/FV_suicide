# FV_suicide
Eye-tracking data processing of Free-view paradigm
Instruction:

The toolbox "Edf2Mat" was used for reading the raw EDF data into Matlab. Seen in (https://github.com/uzh/edf-converter).

The Script "Li_suicide_eyetracking_Git.mat" was the main program in our study to extract eye-tracking index.

There were also some additional functions referenced and used in that main script. All these functions were compiled in the document "Relate_function_collections".

The raw eye-tracking data was collected by Eye-Link 1000 system.(https://www.sr-research.com/)

The main script was originally programmed and running on the version of MatLab2018a.(Windows 10)
